/**
 * The Activity class serves as the entry point for an applications interaction with the user, it provides the window in which the app draws its UI. Each screen that we want to present to the user
 * will be a different instance of Activity. For example, in an Email application we could have an Activity which is responsible for showing the users inbox, then when the user wants to compose
 * a new Email, he/she could click a button, and a new Activity would come onscreen presenting the user with a new UI which they could use to compose an Email. This Activity, which I called MainActivity,
 * is the entry point for this application. When the user launches the app, they will be presented with the UI that we configure for this Activity, and anything they do to interact with the app
 * while this Activity is onscreen will be handled in the code below.
